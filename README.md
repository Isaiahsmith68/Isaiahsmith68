#####    Currently pursuing a Master's degree at Fordham University 🐏 where I specialize in Data Science and Deep Learning. I have developed a data-driven mindset built upon a passion for driving decision-making and change through the vast 
amount of data at our disposal. I love ❤️ sharing my passion with others and being in a field that requires continuous                                          learning due to its incredible community❕
